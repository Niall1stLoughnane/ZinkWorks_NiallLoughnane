* add the ability for a new user to ba added to the ATM and the info given back will include for now the pin since there is no email
    functionality currently in the system
- add the ability for a user to update their pin to a new pin if they provide their current pin as well as the new pin
- add the ability for a user to add money into their account in the ATM - this will update both their own and the ATM current balance
- add a system property for getting the amount the user can dispense from the system - because some banks might not 300 or 200 to be
    dispersed at any one time so this is based on configuration and deployment level. This will also help control the balance of the
    ATM because the amount the user can dispense will be controlled on user, current ATM balance and also global configuration ATM
    level

IT new ideas
- see if annotations can be used to control the flow into the controllers and verify an account exists before it even gets into the
    controller level and if the user account does exist then add this into the flow from the AOP level into the controller level
        -   this will help with logging purposes
- examine if thread local can be used to get the flow of a user account throughout the system for logging and security
